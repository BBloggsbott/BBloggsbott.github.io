I am a final semester student at [SASTRA Deemed to be University](https://sastra.edu), Thanjavur. I am pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I am interested in Machine Learning and it's applications.

I completed Google Summer of Code 2019. Details of the project can be found [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6480296566849536/). I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for the [Climate anomalies and forced displacement](https://omdena.com/displacement/) challenge at Omdena.

I'm working at [Freshworks Inc.](https://www.freshworks.com/) as a Software Development Intern with the [Freddy](https://www.freshworks.com/freddy-ai-engine/) team. I'm also working on improving the model behind [AutoBound](https://github.com/BBloggsbott/autobound) served by [AutoBound server](https://github.com/BBloggsbott/autoboundserver).
