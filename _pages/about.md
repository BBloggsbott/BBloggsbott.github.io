I am a student at [SASTRA Deemed to be University](https://sastra.edu), Thanjavur. I am pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I am interested in Machine Learning and it's applications.

I completed Google Summer of Code 2019. Details of the project can be found [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5892666334642176). I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for the [Climate anomalies and forced displacement](https://omdena.com/displacement/) challenge at Omdena.

I'm currently working on improving the model behind [AutoBound](https://github.com/BBloggsbott/autobound) served by [AutoBound server](https://github.com/BBloggsbott/autoboundserver).
